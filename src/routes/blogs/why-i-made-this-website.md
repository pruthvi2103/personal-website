### Have You Googled Yourself?

As someone wise said, its always wise to to google yourself occasionally and see what comes up. I used to think ‘I ain’t doing anything bad so nothing bad is ever going to come up when I google myself’, it was well, quite a revelation to know that you cannot have the same expectations from people with the same name as you. So to not get mis-identified as a convict and drug dealer I decided to actually sit and finish the website.

Also as i grow my career I actually realise the value of a personal brand and how basically have an identity of my own

As a web developer it always was something I wanted to make but my grandiose ideas of it being a lot more than just a personal website made it an over-ambitious, extremely over-engineered project. However I always try to use something new and unknown to me while making personal projects and while making this website was no different, my experiences is a tale for a different [time](/blogs/making-my-website)
