### The Starting of something amazing

In 2019, I was in the second year and pretty motivated to learn newer things. One opportunity I saw was the second TEDx event of our college, the [website](https://tedxjnec2018.ortigan.com/) for the first was build by our seniors who just graduated and actually gave me a lot of inspiration to be a web developer. But after they had graduated, there was no team left to develop a team, so I took the initiative to lead the team making the website. The team formed out of 3 peers and 1 junior who all were extremely great and the whole process game me a great level of inner satisfaction and set me up for an awesome journey of learning, more importantly **doing by learning**.

### Starting from zero

While I took the responsibility of making the website, I had almost no knowlege about what goes into making an actual website to having it come up when someone types the site’s name in their browser. All i knew was html and css, and the looming ‘to-do’ to take up js eventually (which happened a lot lot later). There was just a list of discovering a lot of things, the number one for me was, git which is something that everyone should at-least try to discover for their first project, Google Drive is simple the worst way to share. Consider learning, don’t be afraid of trying. We tried and failed see [here](https://github.com/pruthvi2103/tedxjnec2019website) the repo wont clone too and frankly the codebase is a mess too, but if it wasn’t for this failure I wouldn’t be at this point at my journey. So we setup the repo, got bootstrap in and kicked off our project.

### A whole new world

While the development was going great, we were exploring great things like typography, media-queries what mobile-first development means (85% of our users were mobile), why having 2 versions of bootstrap not a good idea, and how jquery + stackoverflow makes magic happen. We still were confused on how we were gonna deploy this thing.

Well one day my friend(who was also a member of the team), [Huzaif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huzaif-quazi-8ab8b3142) introduced me to something known as EC2 offered by AWS, for the longest time I had heard about cloud and how its magic, but never saw it myself. And boy was I missing out on a huge world, I got to know about how we can have a linux system and control it directly via something known as SSH and that we can add files via FTP, it was simply crazy how much I did not know at the time (i still don’t know a lot now but i know about it now).

We setup cPanel on the EC2 instance, uploaded our website via FTP using Filezilla and lo and behold, our website had a place to call its home. We got a domain too to go with it and set it up, knowing what CNAME is and how to configure it in the process.

We used google search console to index the website, although not fancy we were able to secure 2nd rank when anyone searched the name of the event (below ted.com) which was a cool moment. We put in analytics and all the fancy stuff you can do with the head tags.

### Time to Engineer some Jugaad

The site was up and everyone was pretty satisfied with it. But there was a requirement out of the site, it had to take bookings. Now when we say bookings, the way of this was well... pretty unconventional, since a TEDx event back in the day was limited to only 100 admits, we had to ‘evaluate’ the attendees and then open up the payment to them to fund the event preparation. The simple way would have been using google forms and then doing some manual work, but being a young eager self-starter. I wanted to implement these things from scratch. Little did I know the knowlege of backend development was extremely vast to fit into the tight timeline set for this, well I still did not fully settle and came up with a small non-conventional solution.

You see Google Forms work great but the only downside being that the UI isn't something to write home about, using some HTML knowlege i figured out a way to use forms as a backend!. At the end of the day its a simple HTML form that has a action link that fires to an api using the form data which then puts it into the sheet, I hacked the code so that my fields have the same ids and the form fires the same action which allowed me to code my custom UI, you can check it out [here](https://2k19tedxjnec.netlify.app/register2) this all is done using a google form behind the scenes, just the ui is done by me.

Next part was payments, since we wanted to ‘look professional’ and accept debit cards and other digital methods, we had a solution known as townscript ready. But it took a good cut out of the payments which I did not like and for me it was a thing about ego where I could not come up with a solution of my own which saved money. I wanted to use a Payment gateway. Most of them were not as mature to have those pre-made UIs and make my life easy, I wanted to generate individual links and track their status to see if accepted attendees have made the payment or not. For this I setup a Paytm Merchant account in TEDx JNEC’s name and generated links for our attended and processed the passes.

### A Project well learned

All in all the process could’ve been way more streamlined but it worked and worked well it did. I was extremely proud that we could handle the whole process without much hiccups.

It’s due to efforts of [Soham Tamboli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soham-tamboli-a34170193/), [Huzaif Quazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huzaif-quazi-8ab8b3142), [Chaitali Tamboliya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitali-tamboliya-b33844171) and [Rucha Kannawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rucha-kannawar-aa70861b3) that we were able to execute this task. It was a task well done indeed and I am pleasantly happy with how things turned out. And it gave me a great boost to pursue the path of web development. I do hope you too have such a project that kicks off your journey and teaches you a lot.
